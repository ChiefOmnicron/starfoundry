# StarFoundry

StarFoundry contains multiple projects.

Core of it all is an industry tool, that I am developing for some time.
Second is an appraisal tool, which was developed as a little side project.

## Crates

The repository follows the monorepo approach.
The following topics describe the different crates.

### Meta-Webserver

Read more in the crate [README.md](meta_webserver/README.md)

## Appraisal

The appraisal tool can either be deployed together with the industry tool, or can be deployed as a standalone version.
For deployment instructions see: TODO
